**Speaker 1:** Good morning, Ingenio. It's Alex from the RSA, because I don't speak to you guys enough.

**Speaker 2:** Good morning. Hi.

**Speaker 1:** I'm actually phoning on behalf of Judy, whose computer has now rebooted itself without any warning, again, for about the umpteenth time.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Which is no good when you're trying to do accounts, and you've got a deadline of, like, yesterday.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Did it shut off completely?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. Yeah, it blue-screened.

**Speaker 2:** It blue-screened, okay.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. So, and it's ongoing blue-screening, so she's restarted it again now, and very soon she's going to throw it out the window. Where is it, darn thing?

**Speaker 2:** All right, let me get a new ticket open for that. 34, lovely. Okay. I'm going to get a new ticket open for Judy, and then we can give her a call.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. Her phone, is your Mobex working now?

**Speaker 2:** No. No, her Mobex isn't working either.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. So, yeah. I'm taking a look into that now.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** At the moment, funnily enough. So, yeah. Her Mobex keeps asking for a code, and when she puts the code in, it just asks for a code, and when she puts the code in, it just asks for a code. So, she's not having a good day.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I don't like it. Okay, let me pop the blue-screen ticket in there, and then I'm going to see if I can pop up in a little bit.

**Speaker 1:** All right.

**Speaker 2:** About the Mobex problem.

**Speaker 1:** All right.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. Thank you.

**Speaker 2:** See you soon. Bye.
