Hi, Thomas, it's Cameron from Ingenio. I just wanted to follow up on the email I sent about 10 minutes ago. I wanted to make sure that you received it and that we are being a bit more proactive with Marie's account. Let me know when you're free, even if it's just for five minutes. We can go from there. I can call you back, and we can go over it. It would be good to mitigate the risk today if possible. Just give me a shout when you're ready. Thanks.
