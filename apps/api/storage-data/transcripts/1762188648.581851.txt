Speaker 1: Hello, hi, it's Cameron. How's it going?

Speaker 2: I'm good, thank you. How are you?

Speaker 1: Good, yeah, yeah, very good, thanks. Sorry, I just saw your response, so I thought I'd call quickly. I could jump on and we can sort of kick things off. We shouldn't need to, basically it's just kind of leaving the machine running overnight really. Is it OK if I start things off and we let it go overnight?

Speaker 2: Yeah, that's great.

Speaker 1: OK, cool. Yeah, I'll jump on now then if that's OK and I can kick it all off.

Speaker 2: Brilliant, thank you.

Speaker 1: Cool, all right, I'll check back in the morning. I'll give you an update then. It should be fine really, once you come in tomorrow it should be OK. One thing I just needed to check, actually it looks like it's... I have connected to it. Is it OK if I sign out? Just really quickly.

Speaker 2: Yes, I don't think I've got anything. Essentially, some laptops say I lose connection when it signs out, but it looks like it's cabled in, so we should be OK.

Speaker 1: In fact, I have lost connection. Is it on the login screen?

Speaker 2: Yes, it is, yeah. And in the bottom right corner, is it like a monitor icon or a globe icon?

Speaker 1: There's a little monitor icon, yeah.

Speaker 2: That's strange, I've literally been kicked off.

Speaker 1: OK, do you need to sign back in?

Speaker 2: Yes, if possible. Sorry, normally if it's got... is it cabled in or is it on the Wi-Fi?

Speaker 1: It's the Ethernet connection.

Speaker 2: That's strange, normally that stays throughout.

Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird, I just got reconnected when you logged in. That's the monitor icon I saw, if that's the one you mean.

Speaker 2: Yeah, just trying to make sure there's no additional connections. I'm going to try restarting it, actually. Give me two seconds. If I just run a command and restart it, are you still available if I call you back if I get disconnected?

Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

Speaker 2: OK, cool. I mean, it'll take me a few minutes to do this, so yeah, if I can't get reconnected in a few minutes, I'll give you a call back.

Speaker 1: OK, no problem.

Speaker 2: Cool.

Speaker 1: OK, thanks for that.

Speaker 2: Thanks.
