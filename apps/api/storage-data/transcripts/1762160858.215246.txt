Speaker 1: What's the company?

Speaker 2: It's not a company, it's just an individual.

Speaker 2: Yes, please. Thank you.

Speaker 1: Thanks very much.

Speaker 2: Thanks.

Speaker 1: Hi, I can't get through. I think they're in a morning meeting actually. I can't get through to them. I'll call later.

Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
