**Cameron:** Hello? Hello, hi, it's Cameron from Eugenio.

**Speaker 2:** Hi, I'll just grab the laptop because there's a very good gap. Can I grab Mike's laptop?

**Cameron:** Oh yeah, yeah, thank you, yeah, amazing. So does it just turn on and leave it running? I had an issue with Diane's where the Wi-Fi wasn't connecting on the login screen. Is Mike's laptop cabled in or is it on Wi-Fi? I imagine it's Wi-Fi. Is this Wi-Fi not working then?

**Speaker 2:** I think it's working, yeah. I'll just turn it on now and then he gave me the password so I can just...

**Cameron:** We could potentially cable it in. We can put it on this one over here. Is there, like, because with Diane what I think happened was it's like an enterprise-grade Wi-Fi, so you have to sign into the Wi-Fi with an email and the password, I think, and it wasn't working on Diane. Joe P is, but Joe H isn't.

**Speaker 2:** Right, I'll just, let me just turn it on and then... I can see it, it's online.

**Cameron:** Is it online? Let me just log in. Do I have to log in or can you do that?

**Speaker 2:** I think I'm okay actually. Can I just click around quick?

**Cameron:** I think... Yeah, I'll let you just click on. Okay, Mike's configured it to... It looks like it's working now.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I think we're okay on Wi-Fi. We're able just to plug in the charger and then I can crack on, that's all.

**Cameron:** Yeah, let me plug it in. That's right. This will still work, yeah, because you've got this. I'll charge you now so you can just...

**Speaker 2:** Is that all good? We'll just leave that going?

**Cameron:** It appears that I have been disconnected from it again. Is the Wi-Fi on? Does it look like it's got Wi-Fi in the bottom corner?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's got the little circle now, it's like the Wi-Fi at the bottom. It's looking like the Wi-Fi isn't working. Have you got any stations that have network cables or a docking station with a network cable?

**Cameron:** I think it can now go on guest. Yeah, if you go on guest... I can try this. All right. Yeah, so this laptop's really annoying, it has to be on the Wi-Fi.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. It's weird how it connected and then it went off. Maybe it isn't reaching it if it was working through there.

**Cameron:** There we go, can you see it now, the Wi-Fi working?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, it takes a little while to connect, give me a sec. It sometimes takes 15-20 seconds. It should, in theory...

**Cameron:** Yeah, I'm back on. Right, if you drop out, just give me a phone call and I can put you back on.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, cool. Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help.

**Cameron:** Cheers.

**Speaker 2:** Cheers, take care, bye.
