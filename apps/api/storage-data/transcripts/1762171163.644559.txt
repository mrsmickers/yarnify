Hi Chris, it's Cameron from Eugenio. I'm just calling quickly because I've received an email and a call from Dell asking if everything's working. I think the on-site engineer has marked the case as complete, so I thought I'd just check with you. Let me know when you get this, maybe in about 5-10 minutes. We can make sure that the original issues are fixed and then go from there. Thanks.
