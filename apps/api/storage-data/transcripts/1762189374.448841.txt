Speaker 1: Hello. 

Speaker 2: Hello. Hi, it's Cameron again.

Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Hello. I'm sorry. I saw you back at the machine.

Speaker 2: Yes. Do you need to use it? Do you want me to sign you back into your account?

Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, I ideally need to do a little bit more work before signing off, if I can. Is that OK?

Speaker 2: I tell you what, how long is this likely to take?

Speaker 1: Yeah, it does take a while. Sorry. I thought we were going to leave it running all night. We can potentially just switch user to your user. It just had to be an admin to kick it off.

Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I'm happy to leave it running all night. I just haven't quite finished work yet.

Speaker 1: That's OK. So on the other user screen, you should be able to type out your email and your normal password, and then that will let you log into your account.

Speaker 2: OK.

Speaker 1: And then you'll be good to go from there. If you've also got a pin, let's say you have a six-digit pin or something to get into the laptop, you can type out your email address. Under sign-in options, you can choose the pin number pad icon, and that will let you put a pin in instead. So you could do that as well, but I'll get you back into your account, and then you'll be good to go.

Speaker 2: Yeah. It's not working.

Speaker 1: So it's your full email address as the username?

Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Can you see my screen still?

Speaker 2: No, it's kicked me off.

Speaker 1: I see. But if you go to sign-in options and you've chosen the key icon, that's your password, or the pin number pad icon, that's a pin. Do you log in with your email password normally or a pin?

Speaker 2: Well, I think the password and the pin should be the same. It doesn't have to be very long. But that's worked with the pin, so that's good.

Speaker 1: OK, cool. Yeah, I think the pin has its own requirements.

Speaker 2: OK, I'll check back in the morning. I've not done it this way before, but I'll check back and just see if it's gone through overnight. If not, we can always do it another night this week. Thank you for that.

Speaker 1: OK, no worries. Thank you.

Speaker 2: Cool. Thanks. Take care.

Speaker 1: Thanks.
