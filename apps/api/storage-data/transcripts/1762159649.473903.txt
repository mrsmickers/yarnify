**Speaker 1:** Good morning, Ingenio. How can I help?

**Speaker 2:** Hi, it's John Whitetead here again.

**Speaker 1:** Hello.

**Speaker 2:** Hello. Right, I've sorted out the issue we had at home.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** And I could be with Cameron in about half an hour, 40 minutes. Would that be OK, or is that not going to help?

**Speaker 1:** Shall I put you through to him, and then he can arrange with you?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, thanks.

**Speaker 1:** I'll try and get you now. Thank you, hold the line.

**Speaker 1:** Did you know we sell managed printers? Never pay for toner, consumables, or repairs again with our fast and colorful printers. Simply pay for what you print. When you're running low on toner, you're sent more automatically. Enjoy full...

**Speaker 3:** Hi, John, Cameron here.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, Cameron, yeah, sorry about that. I did ring a little early. I thought I was going to be unable to get over to you this morning, but I can come over in about half an hour, 40 minutes if you could still fit me in.

**Speaker 3:** If you... Because I was supposed to be with you at nine.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, half nine works, looking at it, yeah.

**Speaker 3:** You think so? We can move some stuff around. I've not really got anything booked in until...

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, OK. Well, I'm having a look, maybe 11, I think. I'll see you around, yeah, in about half an hour, 40 minutes.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, cool.

**Speaker 2:** OK. Thanks, Cameron, cheers.

**Speaker 3:** Thanks, take care. Bye-bye.
