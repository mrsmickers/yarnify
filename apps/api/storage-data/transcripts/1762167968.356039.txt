**Speaker 1:** Hello! Mark, hello, how are you?

**Speaker 2:** Not too bad, not too bad.

**Speaker 1:** Good, good. Sorry I was a bit late. Are you still around to kind of go over this?

**Speaker 2:** I am sitting in front of my laptop at the moment.

**Speaker 1:** Cool, okay. I'm just jumping on the server so I can give you the NetExtender access. Let me just double-check I can access your laptop. Some laptops we can't access anymore, so I just have to set up a one-time remote session for them, but let me just double-check that.

**Speaker 2:** Well, someone's been on it before, so you should be able to. I think John's been updating it and removing access from some, but I can. It's number 53.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, yeah, cool. Let me just jump on it. Okay, yep, cool. You'll find my screen; I've got four screens.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, what screen are we... I've got the one with storage space open. Is that the one we're looking at?

**Speaker 1:** No, well that, yeah, funnily enough, it came up this morning saying that I've got limited space, so I ran this thing and it tells me all the things that I can delete or not delete, as the case may be. I was going to ask you whether that's something we could sort out because I'm running out of space.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, so if I'm okay to borrow the machine... oh, you've got the new NetExtender. I was going to say I need to update NetExtender, but you've got the new one, so that's good.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, but wasn't there something not quite right with it or something?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, so that looks good. We just need to basically link multi-factor authentication, so we need to link it to an app on your phone so it's a bit more secure. Do you have an authenticator app on the phone?

**Speaker 1:** Yes.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, so we'll just link it to that one if you've got a sec. New update available, I'm going to download the new update. Microsoft Authenticator.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, that's the one, that's a good one, yeah, we'll use that. That's cool. I'm just adding you to the group anyway. And the username is just Mark.

**Speaker 2:** Yep, cool, it's already in there.

**Speaker 1:** Cool, in terms of the space, there's a bit of software that we tend to use. I tend to install it, check the files with it, and then remove it afterward because it's one of those ones that just keeps popping up. Oh, you've already got it. We've done this before. This is a good one, TreeSize. I think it needs an admin password to run, though. So I can put in, oh, it's gonna be one of John's, let's see if one of our ones works. Okay, yeah, what screen is it on this one?

**Speaker 2:** Now, it keeps coming up every so often, saying you're near your limit, you're near your limit. I'm thinking, fabulous. But then there's about 15 years of crap on there, so I think, well, all my photographs, I think, are on the cloud anyway, so I'm not quite sure what else is there that doesn't need to be there, really.

**Speaker 1:** So, just got to double-check what, you might be using Mark Hobbs now. You've got two profiles on here, so we could clear out an old profile. Mark Hobbs, just double-check this. Where's that one? It opens on this screen. Let's get something like documents. Yes, okay, so you're, yeah, so you're, Mark Hobbs is your new profile, Mark is your old profile. So we can, yes, you've got, that must be like an old Outlook file, yeah, so we could technically clear out your old Outlook file. Basically, these files appear in your app data, they're stuff that you've synced in the past, but they do still exist, obviously, online, so it's only like a synced version.

**Speaker 2:** Well, I've got, I've got this, yeah, I've got this online archive, which Jimmy's got, I think everything from about 23, 24 backwards.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, so that's, online archives are good.

**Speaker 2:** I need to keep that because I actually used it the other day.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, they don't actually take up space on the PCs. So these ones here, he's got, he's got some migrated stuff, which is fine, we can get rid of that. Essentially, anything under Mark isn't used anymore, and you're now using Mark Hobbs, so we can actually clear up 44 gig.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, that'll do.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I don't tend to touch anything in these folders because they're, Dell shouldn't do that. Yeah, I can, I can clear out that as well, actually. That's left behind from one of their bits of applications. So, yeah, I mean, if you want, I can, I could spend like 10 minutes now clearing that up, that would be 90 gig.

**Speaker 2:** I'll update, because I've got two, five, six of them.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, yeah, I could, I could do both of them. Do you have the authenticator app, is it updated? Is it ready to go?

**Speaker 2:** Hang on, oh, hang on, installing, hang on a second.

**Speaker 1:** That's cool, I can, I can always come back and do that bit if it's easier.

**Speaker 2:** Hang on, hang on, hang on. Unlock, right, well then, what have I got to do?

**Speaker 1:** So, once you've, so you're in the authenticator app, if you've got the screen up, all the accounts, cool, so in the bottom right corner, you'll have the blue, blue icon?

**Speaker 2:** Yep, that's right.

**Speaker 1:** Bear with me, that should ask you to scan the QR code, is that right?

**Speaker 2:** The account finder will display the QR code, yes.

**Speaker 1:** Cool, so on your left screen, the one with NetExtender open, of your computer screen, this is, I'm going to hit connect, and yeah, so this QR code here is the one to, the one to scan?

**Speaker 2:** Would you like to, would you recommend this app, yes?

**Speaker 1:** Ah, you can, you can skip that, I think, is there like a cross, can you, you can?

**Speaker 2:** Just write this app, write this app for Neil.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, they're a bit fishy.

**Speaker 2:** Your first verifier, when you add a verifier to your account screen, scan the QR code.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, so, on your left screen.

**Speaker 2:** These are different names for your new account, you already have, right, what shall I call that then?

**Speaker 1:** Oh, so you've already got one called remote.cleankill.

**Speaker 2:** You already have an account 4433markat2cbdate, blah, blah, blah, yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, maybe you should call it like cleankillvpn or something, or just, or NetExtender, yeah.

**Speaker 2:** VPN.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. And once it's saved, you have to kind of tap into it, and it'll give you a six-digit code, which we just have to type out here on screen.

**Speaker 2:** 94, oh hang on, 165083.

**Speaker 1:** Do you want to type it out and press enter? There's no spaces, you can just literally type out six numbers and press enter.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Perfect. That's you done, yeah. So your NetExtender is now set up. The process going forward, I'll show you what it's like. We'll disconnect it, we'll do it again. The login process going forward is you open up the NetExtender app, and then you just type in your password.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, we'll do it again. The login process going forward is you open up the NetExtender app, and obviously when it opens up you've got your cleankill connection. That remembers your username and password, so you just have to hit the connect button, and then what happens is this screen comes up here.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, it actually needs you to put your password in. Do you have your password to hand?

**Speaker 2:** Is that just my normal login, or is it a special one?

**Speaker 1:** It's just your cleankill password. I don't know if it's linked anymore, but it might be, so you could probably try the normal login one.

**Speaker 2:** This would be to get on a computer generally?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, it might be. I'm not sure these days because John's changed some stuff, but this is the cleankill password, so let's see if that one works.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, cool. That's the right password.

**Speaker 1:** All right, okay. Yeah, so all you have to do is hit the connect button, type out the password, and then for this screen you just go to the Authenticator app on your phone, and then get the new code from the VPN. Yeah, and that's it. So before it used to just be username and password, but now once you've done the username and password it takes you to another screen, and then you just have to put the six-digit code in, so there's just an extra layer of security.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, fine. So obviously previously part of the problem we had was because I think the server was in the office, we only had X number of lines that we could get into it. Is this now a situation where unlimited access, or is it timed access or anything like that?

**Speaker 1:** I still think there's a limit on how many connections can go in at the same time, but I think less people are doing it, so we haven't had any reports of it for a while.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, fine. Sometimes you sort of log on and then you forget, and then I don't know whether someone then can't get in or it blocks you out or something like that.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. Someone else wants to get in. It's always good to disconnect when you're done, but we have not had anyone report it for a while, so I imagine less and less people are doing it.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, fine. Yeah, it's mainly really for Rati, because I think your files are now linked into SharePoint on OneDrive, so you've got your files stored somewhere else these days.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I think the only problem is that we've... I think they were 2023 backwards or something, and funnily enough, the other day we needed something from about 2016, which we couldn't find. I think it's more of a rarity than anything else.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah. Okay, well, yeah, other than that, everything else is the same. So once you've logged into NetExtender, you can just log into Rati like normal. Nothing else has changed on that part, but I'm just going to go through and clear up the files from your machine for you.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, fantastic.

**Speaker 2:** This might take me like 10 minutes or so. Is it okay if I call you back?

**Speaker 1:** Shall I go and make you a cup of tea, then? Is that what you're saying?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, yeah, go for it. Take it easy. I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

**Speaker 1:** All right, no problem. Thanks a lot.

**Speaker 2:** Cheers, mate. Take care. Bye.
