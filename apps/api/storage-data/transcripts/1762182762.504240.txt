Speaker 1: Hiya, it's Joel calling from the G&U.

Speaker 2: Hello Joel, how are you?

Speaker 1: I'm fine, yeah, not bad mate. I was just calling about the issue you were having when you were unplugging your laptop from the dock.

Speaker 2: Oh, I am just driving home at the moment, Joel, so you can't even remote on me, I'm afraid.

Speaker 1: No, not a problem. Is there a time you can book in? Just 15 minutes or so to see if we can get that working again?

Speaker 2: Yeah, tomorrow after... I've got a meeting, so any time after about 9:30. I don't think I've got anything on tomorrow. Let me take a little look. Yes, 9:30 looks good tomorrow morning. Is that okay to book in a call for then?

Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 2: Wonderful. Okay, I'll book in a call for 9:30 tomorrow morning, and we can see if we can get that going again.

Speaker 1: Cool, perfect. Thank you.

Speaker 2: Alright, speak to you then.

Speaker 1: Thanks very much. Bye.

Speaker 2: Cheers. Bye.
