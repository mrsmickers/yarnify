Speaker 1: I'm just working on setting up your new staff as you mentioned. I've just got a quick question if that's okay. So, for the licenses you've popped here, it's for a monthly commitment, is that correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, they're both on a six-month internship.

Speaker 1: Okay, no worries at all. I thought if I try and do this as an annual, that's going to bugger things up. Everything else we do is annual, but because these are specifically six-month internships, one of them might turn into full-time, but we don't know.

Speaker 2: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. That's fine.

Speaker 1: What I'd do is go to our finance team and get that set up because it's the first time it's a monthly license, so they've just got to do a little jiggery-pokery and get that all sorted.

Speaker 2: Lovely. Would I be able to pass over the password now actually as well? I've got that password here.

Speaker 1: Okay, and I'll be working on setting up those laptops for them tomorrow, I believe, as well, so we're getting there.

Speaker 2: Lovely, okay. So for Luke's account, his email address would be luke@abc-translations.co.uk.

Speaker 1: That's right, yep.

Speaker 2: And then his password is GreenWhite53 and then an exclamation mark.

Speaker 1: Any of that uppercase?

Speaker 2: Yes, the 'G' of Green and the 'W' of White are capitalized. GreenWhite53 and an exclamation mark.

Speaker 1: 53, okay.

Speaker 2: Okay, so that's Luke's, and then I've got Mahari's here. That password is OrangePurple57 and then a question mark. I've got a bit of a color theme going on here.

Speaker 1: 57 and a question mark, lovely.

Speaker 2: Yes, and it's a capital 'O' and a capital 'P'.

Speaker 1: Perfect.

Speaker 2: Okay, that's lovely. Yeah, and the email is luke@abc-translations.co.uk.

Speaker 1: Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 2: Yeah, and the same with Mahari's.

Speaker 1: That's correct.

Speaker 2: Lovely, okay, so thank you very much. I will add those to my key now so I've got a note.

Speaker 1: Fantastic, okay. All right, speak to you soon.

Speaker 2: Brilliant, and that's presumably their Microsoft login if they want to do online or log into the computer before they set the pins.

Speaker 1: Yes, yes, that's right.

Speaker 2: Lovely, okay, thanks very much.

Speaker 1: Cheers.

Speaker 2: Thanks very much.

Speaker 1: Thank you. Bye.
