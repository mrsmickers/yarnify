**Speaker 1:** Hello?

**Speaker 2:** Hi, yeah, it's Joel. I'm calling back from JNEO.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, hi.

**Speaker 2:** Hi. I'm just calling back in regards to the Sentinel-1. I've managed to back up now and update to whatever the new one is.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, okay. That's the one, yeah. Do you have the administrator password?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I seem to. I tried logging on as administrator and it worked, so yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. Yeah, let's try that then. Would I be able to jump back on and see if we can get those permissions?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, lovely. Apologies, I'm a bit late calling again. It's been a bit hectic today.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, so we go back to system settings. We've got to go down to privacy and security.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** And then we want to do full disk access. Click on that little plus icon to the left.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** This is where it would ask. Okay, let's try again.

**Speaker 2:** Amazing, that worked. I'm just going to grab the correct path and get that added, then double-check in the portal that it's happy after that. Because, yeah, basically, without these permissions, it isn't able to scan everything that it needs to.

**Speaker 1:** Right, yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, another one, two, one. This one. Shout, that might be. Okay, right, that's got the permissions it needs now. I'm just going to double-check the notification permissions as well, because it does need those. And I'm just going to double-check on the portal to make sure that's all gone through.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Lovely, it looks like it's got notification permissions. Let's just double-check on the portal. Hopefully, we should be all good to go now.

**Speaker 1:** Okay.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah. Just logging into that portal now. Sorry, it does take a minute to log in. Are the other computers all up to date?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, yeah, it's literally just this. We do checks every month. If it's saying anything like, oh, it's not got the full permissions, then we'll know about it.

**Speaker 2:** How many computers do you have on that?

**Speaker 1:** Since the one, it's split across two different consoles, so quite a few. I'd say about 900.

**Speaker 2:** No, no, I mean for us.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, for you guys, four, just the four.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah. Four, one, two, three, four. Okay, yeah. It doesn't look like it's updated just yet. Are we okay to try restarting the Mac now we've done that?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** It does also look like your other Mac is requiring the same permissions, so we could try doing it on there as well.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, what do you want me to restart?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, please, yeah. The other one, I have a feeling it needs to be charged up because I did go to check that and it wasn't starting there. Plugging in. And yeah, just have to do the same thing on that one as well, and hopefully, we should be all good after that.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, so which one do you want me to log into?

**Speaker 2:** Have you got the other MacBook?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, if you could log into that for me.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, let's just make sure I log into that.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, let's hope we don't have the same problem. It doesn't really matter for this, actually. You can go into admin if you'd like, but we will need that admin password at some point. So just really the usual one you sign in with, or if you don't know that one, then the admin one would also work.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, let me just try this one. So ConnectWise is required.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, that's me, yes. So yeah, if you could hit allow on that, it just means I can see what you can see on the screen.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, I'm just saying, which one's which? Not so much.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, okay, I think I know what I've done now. Yeah, and that's just me again. Lovely. I'm just going to check those permissions on this one as well now. I'm just going to check in here. It does look like this one needs the same software update as your other Mac as well, but that's fine.

**Speaker 1:** Really? You don't have to do that.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, it does look like it needs the update as well by the looks of things.

**Speaker 1:** I would have thought it does. Did you say it doesn't?

**Speaker 2:** It does. Sorry, it does.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, yeah, definitely, yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, yeah, it does look like we're missing one of those. Would you be able to pop in the admin details here for me?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, lovely, thank you. Let me just get those added. Looks like it's just lagging a little bit behind.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, okay. And then I'm just going to check the notification permissions as well.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, that's great, okay.

**Speaker 2:** Let me just double-check on the portal. If you could sign back into your other MacBook as well now that it's restarted. Lovely, it looks like that is all enabled. Great, it looks like that is already on that MacBook now. I'm just going to double-check on the original one that it's all happy as well. Ah, there we go. So, that's just updated on our side as well now. Yes, that's all happy again now. So, yeah, both of them are all good to go. They've got the right permissions they need now. And that's pretty much it, yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, it says now umbrella adaptive, okay.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, it just does take a minute when the computer gets restarted for things like Cisco Umbrella to kind of kick back in again. The only thing left is just to run that update on your other MacBook.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, of course, you can do that whenever really, it's no big deal.

**Speaker 2:** So, yeah, we're good to go. Thanks so much for your time.

**Speaker 1:** Great. Right. Thank you very much.

**Speaker 2:** No worries.

**Speaker 1:** All right. Thank you very much. Cheers. Bye.
