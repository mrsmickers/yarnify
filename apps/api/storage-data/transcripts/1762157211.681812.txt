Speaker 1: Hello, Jeannie O'Cameron speaking.

Speaker 2: O'Cameron, how are you? It's Kelly.

Speaker 1: Oh hi, yeah, good thanks. How are you? It's a bit early for me to ring in. There's obviously a problem, isn't there?

Speaker 2: Lovely Joel gave me our new man's password on Thursday, and I didn't check it on Friday. I really should have because I need to set up all his email and stuff over the weekend. And then I've gone to try and log in, and well, it's not right. So can you send me his password somewhere or just tell it to me or put it anywhere?

Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be a new one. We don't save it anywhere, so what's the one he gave you?

Speaker 2: Oh, well, it was QORANGE52! and I've tried all different variations of that, capital Q. I'm guessing the word Q. Maybe it's low, maybe. I should have taken more notice. I wonder if it was actually the word, yeah, I wonder if it was lowercase Q.

Speaker 1: Do you think it was? I thought you said capital Q though. Are you trying the word Q or the letter Q?

Speaker 2: Well, I was trying the letter Q. I think he normally, well, normally you'd put two words together, you get like a password randomizer, so I'm guessing it's the word Q?

Speaker 1: So what, QUE?

Speaker 2: UE, yeah. No, doesn't like that. QUE, capital O, he definitely said capital O, ORANGE52! No, can we just reset it?

Speaker 1: Have you tried UE UE? Q. QUE UE? Q.

Speaker 2: I mean, that would be very complex. He would have spelled that out for me, wouldn't he? Oh, you're so annoying, Cameron. I actually hate you, I actually hate you. I just did it, the randomizer just puts two words together for me. Q U E U, is that what I just put in then? Q U E U E? I tell you what, that's not complex, is it? That's going to be really fun, that one. Thanks, nice talking to you.

Speaker 1: When you're in, I'm guessing you're on a machine in the Worthing branch?

Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Yeah, when you're in, if you press CTRL or DELETE, you can do a change password, and you can set your own one up because you've got direct communication to the server from Worthing. So yeah, you can just do a CTRL or DELETE and change the password once you've logged in.

Speaker 2: Okay, alright, thanks very much. Have a wondrous day, see you later, bye.

Speaker 1: Take care, bye.
