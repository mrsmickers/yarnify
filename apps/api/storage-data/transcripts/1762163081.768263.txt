Speaker 1: Hello.

Speaker 2: Hi Chris, it's Cameron.

Speaker 1: Hi Cameron, how are you?

Speaker 2: Good, thanks. Yeah, how are you?

Speaker 1: Good, yeah, not too bad, not too bad.

Speaker 2: Good, good. I sent an email about half an hour ago.

Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I haven't really been at my computer.

Speaker 2: No, no, it's okay, it's okay. I just thought I'd let you know that I was trying to get confirmation from Dell for today. They're not really very good at communicating, but I've had a call from the engineer. Apparently, he is close to the Keeble house.

Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Is today still good for them to head over and replace the part?

Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I'm only around until about one o'clock today. I've got to go out to a site this afternoon.

Speaker 1: He should be there in about 10 to 15 minutes. Very short notice. He was just like, "I'm there."

Speaker 2: Okay, well, I'm not there, but I said to him, "You need to speak to Chris Leonard." So I think I gave the main number as the primary contact number. So, yeah, he should be with you soon. All he needs is a desk space where he can take apart your laptop. The main thing I always say to people when there's a Dell engineer coming on site is to please make sure you test the original issue with him when he's there. So, if he's replacing parts to help with the camera or the microphone, maybe just do a quick test to confirm it works while he's there. Sometimes they just go there, replace the part, get you to sign it off, and then leave without testing it afterwards. So it's a good idea to ask them to confirm that the original issue is actually fixed. But yeah, he shouldn't be there too long. I imagine he'll be in and out within half an hour.

Speaker 1: Yeah. OK. Cool.

Speaker 2: All right. Well, let me know how you get on. I'm around if you need anything else. Just give us a shout.

Speaker 1: Yeah. OK. Brilliant. Thanks a lot, Cameron.

Speaker 2: Cool. Thanks. Take care.

Speaker 1: All right. Cheers. Bye.

Speaker 2: Bye.
