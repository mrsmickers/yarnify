Speaker 1: Hello. Hello.

Speaker 2: Hi, it's Cameron again. I'm all done.

Speaker 1: All done? Oh, right, OK. Marvellous. We've got about 94 gig now.

Speaker 2: Oh, bloody hell. That'll do. Yeah, it's just the old profile that you had—your Clean Kill profile before you moved to the Pest Control Partnership profile. And then, yeah, Dell has this application that's known to leave a large amount of data behind, so I just kind of cleared that as well.

Speaker 1: OK. Marvellous. All right. Thank you very much indeed.

Speaker 2: Nice, no worries. Much appreciated.

Speaker 1: See if anything else comes up.

Speaker 2: No worries.

Speaker 1: OK, will do. All right. Thanks a lot.

Speaker 2: Cheers. Bye-bye.
