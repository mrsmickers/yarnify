**Cameron:** Oh, hi, it's Cameron again. Sorry, the laptop—I restarted it and then I think it's disconnected from the Wi-Fi. I can't really tell. Yeah, the Wi-Fi dropped out for like the whole building.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Cameron:** Yeah, it was just, yeah. It's probably my fault for not telling it to auto-connect. What I didn't want to do is tell it to auto-connect to the guest Wi-Fi because that means when Mike actually uses it, it will auto-connect to the guest Wi-Fi. So is it possible to maybe just go to the Wi-Fi and just get it to connect to one, just as a one-off on his laptop?

**Speaker 2:** Onto the guest one?

**Cameron:** Yeah, either one. Yeah, just whichever one connects.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Cameron:** Okay, I'll just go and grab it and then give me a sec, I'll bring it.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, thanks.

**Cameron:** Yeah, okay. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think what I was, so I started with just like having a quick scan over there for custom notes and doing a bit of research into the people before I pick up the phone. So I'm not going to just like, I'll just start cold-calling the decision-makers in the company. I think I need to do a bit of background research into what they are, what they do.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, you should see it now in a couple of, in a bit.

**Cameron:** Oh, cool. Thank you. As long as it's on the Wi-Fi, I can log back in as our admin account and yeah, go from there.

**Speaker 2:** Great.

**Cameron:** Cool, thanks. I'll give you a shout if I get stuck.

**Speaker 2:** Thank you.

**Cameron:** Okay, thanks, bye.

**Speaker 2:** Bye.
