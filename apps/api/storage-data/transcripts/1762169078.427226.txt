Speaker 1: Hello. 

Speaker 2: Hello. Hi, it's Cameron again. 

Speaker 1: I'm all done. 

Speaker 2: All done? 

Speaker 1: Oh, right, OK. Marvellous. You've got about 94 GB now. 

Speaker 2: Oh, bloody hell. That'll do. 

Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just the old profile that you had, your clean kill profile before you moved to the Pest Control Partnership profile. And then, yeah, Dell has a list of applications known to leave a large amount of data behind, so I just cleared that as well. 

Speaker 2: OK. Marvellous. 

Speaker 1: All right. Thank you very much indeed. 

Speaker 2: Nice, no worries. Much appreciated. Let's see if anything else comes up. 

Speaker 1: No worries. 

Speaker 2: OK, will do. 

Speaker 1: All right. Thanks a lot. 

Speaker 2: Cheers. Bye-bye.
