**Receptionist:** Good afternoon, Ingenio. How can I help?

**Caller:** Good afternoon. Is George available, please?

**Receptionist:** He's not in the office, I'm afraid. He's on-site.

**Caller:** OK. What is it regarding?

**Receptionist:** Luke from Go Plastic Pallets. I sent him an email last night. Is he on-site for the rest of the week?

**Receptionist:** Let me just double-check his calendar. He's got placeholders. Let me just check our team's calendar and see, because that should have a little bit more detail. He should be in the office tomorrow, I believe.

**Caller:** OK, I'll send him another email in that case.

**Receptionist:** OK. It's at the top of his list.

**Caller:** All right, perfect. Thank you.

**Receptionist:** Thanks so much. Cheers, bye.

**Caller:** Cheers, bye.
