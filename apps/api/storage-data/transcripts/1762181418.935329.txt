Speaker 1: Hi Rachel, this is George. How are you doing?

Speaker 2: Hiya George, you alright?

Speaker 1: I'm alright, yes. I'm just playing around in the background really.

Speaker 2: Yeah, just so you know, somebody called Sylvia is about to use Desk 2. Is that going to be okay?

Speaker 1: Oh no, no, no, that's no trouble at all. Let me just sign out. I think I've just signed in as Chatham, that's alright. She won't be too long here, so I can let you know when we're all set. She'll be okay, but you can just get her to sign in for me.

Speaker 2: Okay, it's me doing it actually.

Speaker 1: No trouble. The other two PCs are just sitting on the side though, so you're alright to do that.

Speaker 2: No worries at all. Kind of, yeah, I'm just mucking around with some things in the back end really, which is no problem.

Speaker 1: Okay. Essentially, yeah, once everyone's finished for the day, we will need to just hop around the PCs as part of the process.

Speaker 2: Yep, I shall leave them all on, yeah.

Speaker 1: I'll probably need you for about 10 minutes per PC, just to go through some bits, if that works for you, if that's okay?

Speaker 2: Yep, you need me here while you do that, yeah?

Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, yeah, so once that bit's all done, then I can let you get on with your evening and we'll go from there.

Speaker 2: Okay, I'll give you a call a bit later.

Speaker 1: No worries at all, speak to you then. Take care.

Speaker 2: Cheers, bye.

Speaker 1: Cheers, bye.
