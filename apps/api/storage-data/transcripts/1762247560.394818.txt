Speaker 1: Hello, hi, it's Cameron from Ingenio. Is Geri around?

Speaker 2: She's just popped out of the office. I think she's on the phone. She should be back in a few minutes. Do you want me to get her to give you a call back?

Speaker 1: Yeah, if you could just let her know I called to go over the Cyber Essentials stuff.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll get her to give you a call.

Speaker 1: Cool, thank you.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Bye.
