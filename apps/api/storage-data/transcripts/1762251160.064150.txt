**Speaker 1 (Alex):** Good morning, Ingenio. It's Alex from the RSA. I don't speak to you guys enough. Good morning.

**Speaker 2:** Hi.

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** I'm actually phoning on behalf of Judy, whose computer has now rebooted itself without any warning again for about the umpteenth time, which is no good when you're trying to do accounts and you've got a deadline of, like, yesterday.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Did it shut off completely?

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** Yeah. Yeah, it blue-screened.

**Speaker 2:** It blue-screened. Okay.

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** Yeah. And it's ongoing blue-screening, so she's restarted it again now, and very soon she's going to throw it out the window. Darn thing.

**Speaker 2:** All right. Let me get Ingenio open for that. 34.

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** 34, lovely. Okay. I'm going to get a new ticket open for Judy, and then we can give her a call.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Is your Mobex working now?

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** No. No, her Mobex isn't working either.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. So...

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** I'm taking a look into that now. Yes, at the moment, funnily enough. So...

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** Her Mobex keeps asking for a code, and when she puts the code in, it just asks for a code again. So...

**Speaker 2:** Okay. She's not having a good day.

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** Yeah, I like it. Okay. Let me pop the blue-screen ticket in there, and then I'm going to see if I can pop up in a little bit about the Mobex problem.

**Speaker 2:** All right.

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** Okay. Thank you.

**Speaker 2:** All right. Bye.

**Speaker 1 (Alex):** Bye.
