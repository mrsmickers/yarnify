**Automated System:** Thank you for calling Ingenio Technologies. To help us direct your call, please select from one of the following options. One for support.

**Joel:** Ingenio Technologies, Joel speaking. Hello, how may I help?

**Stephen:** Joel, hi. This is Stephen Honey at New Haven Town Council.

**Joel:** Hi, how are you?

**Stephen:** Good, thank you. I've got a problem. One of my colleagues is off sick. She's got COVID, and we think she's going to be off for a few days. We've got stuff she's dealing with that I need to be able to take over, so I need to be able to get access to her emails. Normally, you would need Ken Dry's approval for this, but he's away on holiday as well. I'm his deputy, so I am, in effect, him while he's away on holiday. So, I don't really do it with just my authority.

**Joel:** And do you know whose emails you need access to?

**Stephen:** It's Laurie. That's L-A-U-R-I. My name is Martin. M-A-R-S-T-E-N.

**Joel:** Okay, what I'm going to do is make a new ticket for you to see if we can get you access to Laurie's emails. To be quite honest, I'd have to check in terms of approval if we can do that. I'll raise the question.

**Stephen:** Yeah, I can get the chair of the council, who Ken reports to, to email you or something if needed.

**Joel:** No worries, that's fine. Let me just check your listed approvers for New Haven Town Council. Okay, yeah, the only one that's listed as an approver is Ken at the minute.

**Stephen:** I would agree with that, yeah.

**Joel:** That's fine. I'm going to make a new ticket. I'll make our dispatcher aware and raise the question with them. This might be something that account management needs to deal with and kind of say, "Hey, do you want to add yourself or someone else as an approver?"

**Stephen:** Legally, I am Ken while he's not here. I'm what's known as the proper officer. I don't know if that will help them at all, but yes, when he's back, I'm going to get him to try and change this.

**Joel:** That's fine. Okay, I'm going to get that ticket made. I'll raise the question with the team, and then we'll get back to you if that's okay. Apologies for that. It's not an easy one.

**Stephen:** No, it's all right. I understand.

**Joel:** Yeah, we've got to follow the processes, if that makes sense. Leave that with me, and we'll see what we can do.

**Stephen:** Great. Thanks very much.

**Joel:** Thanks very much. Bye.

**Stephen:** Cheers. Bye.
