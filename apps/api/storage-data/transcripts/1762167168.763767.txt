Speaker 1: Good morning, Ingenio Technology.

Speaker 2: Morning. Can I speak to Cameron, please?

Speaker 1: Who am I speaking with?

Speaker 2: It's Mike Williamson from Clean Kill.

Speaker 1: Clean Kill. Cameron is currently on the phone. I can have him give you a call as soon as he's off.

Speaker 2: Hi, how are you doing? Long time no speak.

Speaker 1: I know. You doing okay?

Speaker 2: Yeah, not too bad at all. Just full of this bloody cold, which everybody seems to be getting, but there you go.

Speaker 1: Well, you know, kids are back at school, so, yep, goodies are spreading all over the place.

Speaker 2: Yeah. I had a wedding in Devon last week, and I think everybody's got together and given out all their presents.

Speaker 1: Yes, that could be it, too. They can keep them.

Speaker 2: Now, Cameron called me before I left. I was off all last week and he said, you know, when can we organize? We could have got an update in that extender.

Speaker 1: Oh, okay. No worries. So if he can give me a call as soon as possible, I'm actually here today, so any time today would be really good.

Speaker 2: In today. Okay, no worries. Thank you.

Speaker 1: Okay, thanks, Mike. Have a good one.

Speaker 2: And you. Cheers. Bye.

Speaker 1: Okay, bye.
