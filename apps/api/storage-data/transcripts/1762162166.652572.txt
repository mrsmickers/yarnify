Speaker 1: Good morning, junior epidemiologist, George speaking. How can we help?

Speaker 2: Hi George, where should we send, please?

Speaker 1: Pardon, sorry? Zem, Zem Hassan?

Speaker 2: Ah, sorry, can I ask who's calling, please?

Speaker 3: It's a Dell technician.

Speaker 1: Oh, I'll just see if I can get a hold of her for you. Bear with me a few seconds. Did you know we sell managed printers? Never pay for toner, consumables, or repairs again with our fast and colorful printers. Simply pay for what you print when you're running low on toner.

[Pause]

Speaker 1: Hi sir, I've just tried to get through to her. Unfortunately, she's actually out on a site visit this morning. Is this in regards to an open case she has, I take it?

Speaker 3: Ah, yeah, I'm coming to fix the laptop.

Speaker 1: Oh, not to worry. You're coming to our office, I take it? It's the Science Innovation Centre?

Speaker 3: Yes, I've got her address, RS194QA.

Speaker 1: Perfect, no worries. See you then. There's plenty of other people in, so one of us will be able to assist you with that.

Speaker 3: Okay, thank you.

Speaker 1: No worries at all. Just so we can keep an eye out for you, do you know approximately how long you'll be?

Speaker 3: I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

Speaker 1: No worries at all, see you then.

Speaker 3: Okay, cheers.

Speaker 1: Take care.

Speaker 3: Cheers.
