Speaker 1: Good morning, this is Leanna from Ingenio. Can I speak to Stuart Pratt, please?

Speaker 2: Yeah, let me see if I can put you through to him.

Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.

Speaker 2: Hi there, apologies, I can't seem to get through to him at the moment. He should be around. Would you like me to have him give you a call back?

Speaker 1: No, it's okay, I'll send him an email instead. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2: Okay, thanks, bye-bye.
