**Speaker 1:** Good morning, Ingenio. How can I help?

**Speaker 2:** Oh hi, good morning. Please, can I just find out about my order? What's happening? Do I need to wait a bit longer? I've got a ticket number.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, what's your ticket number?

**Speaker 2:** The order ticket is hashtag 1421644.

**Speaker 1:** Are you calling from Active Sussex?

**Speaker 2:** I'm sorry?

**Speaker 1:** Are you calling from Active Sussex?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I am.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, let me have a look at that. Zane is scheduled on that ticket for tomorrow.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, okay. So is someone going to come back to me, or is he?

**Speaker 1:** I'm just trying to read the ticket. I'm not tech, so I don't actually know what they do. She's booked in for 9:45 a.m. tomorrow until 10:45, so she's got an hour booked on that. I will double-check when she comes in and get her to contact you.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because I haven't heard anything. I don't know whether it's remote or in person. I don't know anything.

**Speaker 1:** It will be remote, I would assume, but Zane will be in shortly.

**Speaker 2:** Is she on site today?

**Speaker 1:** Let me have a look. She's on site this morning; she'll be in this afternoon, so I will speak to her and get her to contact you just to run through what she's going to need.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, great. Thank you.

**Speaker 1:** No problem. Thank you.
