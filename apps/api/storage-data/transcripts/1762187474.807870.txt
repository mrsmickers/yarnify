Speaker 1: Good afternoon, Ingenio. How can I help?

Speaker 2: Hello? Yeah, afternoon. Can you get me through to Simon, please?

Speaker 1: He's not available, I'm afraid. Can I take a message?

Speaker 2: Oh, you're not on the railway, then?

Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll send it to you.

Speaker 2: I appreciate it.
