**Cameron:** Hello?

**Ramesh:** Hello? This is Ramesh from Dell Technical Support. Am I speaking to Jain Hassan?

**Cameron:** No, it's Cameron.

**Ramesh:** Sir, could you just connect me to Jain Hassan because he has reported an issue with the Latitude 3540 system. So I just need to check. There was a service that has been completed.

**Cameron:** Okay, Cameron, I just see your email has been there. Cameron Esh, am I correct?

**Ramesh:** Yes, yeah, that's me.

**Cameron:** Yes, that would be perfect. So I'll just give you the service tag number. There was a technician that has been sent and has replaced a part for the audio issue. So could you please just confirm if the issue has been resolved? Can you go ahead and just close this ticket?

**Ramesh:** I don't know, I'm not the on-site contact. What's the service tag?

**Cameron:** The service tag number would be F for Foxtrot, number 5, 3 for Charlie, L for Lima, H for Hotel, X for X-ray, number 3. I just see your email today asking, would it be possible to get confirmation on this? Is the engineer supposed to be out today?

**Ramesh:** Yeah, the engineer called me probably like 20 minutes after I sent that, saying he's there. And I told him to call the on-site contact, who is Chris Leonard, who I put on the ticket. I haven't heard anything from him or Chris. I don't know, has he finished the on-site?

**Cameron:** Yes, I just see it has been finished. So could you please just check on that? I can just see the service report has been also sent to Zane Hasson.

**Ramesh:** Sure, yeah, I don't know why, but Zane always gets put on the tickets. I'll have to phone Chris and give you a call back afterwards. Can I email you back once I've heard from him?

**Cameron:** That would be perfect, thank you for that.

**Ramesh:** Okay, alright, give me a sec.

**Cameron:** Thank you.
