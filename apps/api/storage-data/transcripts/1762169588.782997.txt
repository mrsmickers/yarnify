**Speaker 1:** Hello. Wayne, hi, it's Cameron from A Genie. How are you doing?

**Speaker 2:** Hello, good thanks. Yeah, how are you?

**Speaker 1:** I'm not too bad, thank you.

**Speaker 2:** Good, good. Sorry I missed your email, it's been a hectic exit.

**Speaker 1:** That's right, mate. I completely forgot about it as well. I'm surrounded by paperwork myself now, so yeah, I forgot about it too, but we're back.

**Speaker 2:** Ah, no worries, all good. I just thought I'd check in and see if we could book in a quick 10-minute call.

**Speaker 1:** It's done, mate. I'm literally on my thing right now, so if you want to do it now, that'd be easiest because I'm out the rest of the week.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah? I don't know if you've got the 10 minutes to do your thing.

**Speaker 1:** I do, yeah, I do. Are you on your laptop? Is it free?

**Speaker 2:** It is, yeah, it is free. I'm on a police website, but it's fine, just do your thing.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, yeah, I'll just jump on quickly. All right. We'll go through. So, do you remember what app on your phone you linked this to? Do you know how you linked it to an authenticator app on your phone for NetExtender?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, yeah.

**Speaker 1:** So, we just basically need to remove it from that app and then relink it again from scratch. It's essentially like resetting it. Do you have the phone to hand, or is it this phone?

**Speaker 2:** Oh, yeah, it's literally right in my hands and you're on speaker. Let me just turn you up. Yeah, the app's all open.

**Speaker 1:** Cool. Is it the app that's kind of like a blue shield with a blue person in it? Is it that app?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, yeah. So, if you load into it, what accounts do you have listed? Like how many have you got?

**Speaker 2:** I have the top one, which is like a white with a briefcase, which is Wayne at Clean Kill. And the bottom one is reremote at cleankill.co.uk4433.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. So, for that one, can you tap into that? So, it brings up a new screen.

**Speaker 2:** It does. I've got a code which is 525443.

**Speaker 1:** Cool. So, in the top right corner, do you have a cog icon? Settings cog.

**Speaker 2:** Sorry, the phone line's going a bit.

**Speaker 1:** That's right. Yeah, it's got that one. We've got the 4433. That's what we do. I want to remove the account.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, let's remove it.

**Speaker 1:** Yep. Cool. And then in the bottom right corner, do you have a blue icon now? Can you click on the blue icon?

**Speaker 2:** It's asking me to scan a QR code.

**Speaker 1:** Yes. Yeah, that's the one. Give me two seconds. I'll just make sure we can get that QR code. Right. So, the QR code should come up on your screen, on your laptop screen. Ah, we just need to type out your password. Okay. And that's the QR code. Yeah. So, if you scan that with the camera, we should re-add the remote.cleankill account.

**Speaker 2:** Would you recommend this app?

**Speaker 1:** I'll just skip that. Yeah, they're a bit pushy with that.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I've now got, it's like an RE the same thing, but now it's blue. RE433, the same number.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. So, if you tap into that, do you have a six-digit code?

**Speaker 2:** I do. 7272. The phone went a little bit there. I'll let you type. You just have to type it out and press enter.

**Speaker 1:** Sorry, the phone went a bit there.

**Speaker 2:** Cool. Sorry, I'm not sure if it's my end or your end. The phone just keeps going up. Can you hear me?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, it's about, yeah, these phones are awful. It's probably me.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. I can hear you a bit now. Yeah. So, that's all done. You're good to go. So, you don't have to scan it every time. That's just a one-time thing, but you will have to, obviously, like you did before.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, you're good. Thanks for that.

**Speaker 1:** No worries. Thank you very much.

**Speaker 2:** That's all right, mate. All right. Bye.
