Speaker 1: Hello?

Speaker 2: Hi, yes, Joel calling from DNA.

Speaker 1: Hi Joel, how are you doing?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm fine.

Speaker 1: Good. You said something about leave. Was that all I said?

Speaker 2: Ah, well, it was, except I didn't write my password down properly and I wasn't able to get in all weekend. Then I called at 8 o'clock and said, "Cameron, I can't get in. What's the password?" And then he started going, "I'll try Q-U-E-U." I was like, "Oh, fuck off, it worked, didn't it?" So I've been trying to come up with different combinations of the password you gave me all weekend. Then Cameron just said, "Why don't you try this?" And I was like, "Oh, I hate you." Anyway, yeah, so the long and short of it is, we are now in and everything looks OK so far.

Speaker 1: Yeah. Wonderful.

Speaker 2: OK, that's great.

Speaker 1: Yeah, any issues or things like that, let me know.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I will do. Thanks, Joel. See you later.

Speaker 1: Bye.

Speaker 2: Thanks very much. Bye.
