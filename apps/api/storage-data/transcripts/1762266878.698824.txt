Speaker 1: Good afternoon, Ingenio. How can I help you?

Speaker 2: Oh, hi. Can I speak to Simon Smith, please?

Speaker 1: He's not in the office, I'm afraid. Is there anything I can help with?

Speaker 2: Could you just say that Eve called from MNA Digital, please?

Speaker 1: From where, sorry? NMA?

Speaker 2: M-N-A Digital.

Speaker 1: M-N-A Digital. And it was Eve?

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: Perfect, I will let him know when he's back in.

Speaker 2: Thank you.
