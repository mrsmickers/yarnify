**Speaker 1:** Engineering Technologies, Joel speaking. Hello, how may I help?

**Speaker 2:** Joel, hi. This is Stephen Honey at New Haven Town Council.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, hi, hi. How are you?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, not bad, thanks.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, cool. I've got a problem. One of my colleagues is off sick with COVID, so we think she's going to be off for a few days. We've got stuff she's dealing with that I need to take over, so I need to get access to her emails. Normally, you would need Ken Dry's approval for this, but he's away on holiday as well. I'm his deputy, so I can act on his behalf while he's away. I can do it with just my authority.

**Speaker 1:** And do you know whose emails you need access to?

**Speaker 2:** It's Laurie, that's L-A-U-R-I, and the surname is Marsten, M-A-R-S-T-E-N.

**Speaker 1:** M-A-R-S-T-E-N, lovely, thank you. OK, what I'm going to do is make a new ticket for you to see if we can get you access to Laurie's emails. To be quite honest, I'd have to check in terms of approval if we can do that. I'll raise the question.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I can get the chair of the council, who Ken reports to, to email you or something if needed.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, if you let me know what you need.

**Speaker 2:** No worries, that's fine.

**Speaker 1:** Let me just check your listed approvers for New Haven Town Council. OK, yeah, it looks like the only one listed as an approver is Ken at the minute.

**Speaker 2:** I think we need to have that changed.

**Speaker 1:** I would agree with that, yes.

**Speaker 2:** When he's not here, we need to.

**Speaker 1:** No, exactly. But that's fine. I'm going to make a new ticket. I'll make our dispatcher aware and raise the question with them. This might be something that account management needs to deal with and kind of say, "Hey, do you want to add yourself or someone else as an approver?" Let me pop that in as well.

**Speaker 2:** Legally, I am Ken while he's not here. I'm what's known as the proper officer. I don't know if that will help them at all. But then, yes, when he's back, I'm going to try and change this.

**Speaker 1:** That's fine. Let me add that in. OK, I'm going to get that ticket made, and I'll raise the question with the team. We'll get back to you if that's OK. Apologies for that. It's not an easy one.

**Speaker 2:** No, it's all right. I understand. We've got to follow the processes, if that makes sense. Leave that with me, and we'll see what we can do.

**Speaker 1:** Great. Thanks very much.

**Speaker 2:** Thanks very much. Cheers. Bye.
