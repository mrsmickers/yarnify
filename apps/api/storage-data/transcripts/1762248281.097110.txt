Speaker 1: Hello. 

Speaker 2: Hello. How are you?

Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm alright. I've got Emily from Phoenix on the phone. I just realized I've got double-stacked P1s. I'm really sorry. I did an emergency request for change and then got called to do something else. So I'm really sorry about that.

Speaker 2: Awesome. So Phoenix is down. I've got Emily on the phone. She's there. She said she came in and everything looked like they had a power outage. They've restarted everything, but they still don't have anything. If you could talk her through doing a couple of other things, they might have to call their internet provider because I don't think it's us. Let me check ICUK. I'm not sure if they're in there or not. But yeah, I don't know. I want to say it's Gordon. Gordon went and did it himself, so I don't know.

Speaker 1: Okay. All right. We were trying to give them an ICUK, and he's like, "No, no, no, I'm going to go with this company because they said fire her to the cabinet and stuff like that. Or fire her to the building."

Speaker 2: Okay. Let me take a look at their site photos. Jesus Christ, these are old. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Okay. I can try. Would you like to talk to Emily?

Speaker 1: Sure.

Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay. Here you go.
