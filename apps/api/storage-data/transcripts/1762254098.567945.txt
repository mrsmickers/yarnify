**Cameron:** Hello? Hello, hi, it's Cameron from Eugenio.

**Speaker 1:** Hi, I'll just grab the laptop because there's a very good gap. Can I grab Mike's laptop?

**Cameron:** Oh yeah, yeah, thank you, yeah, amazing. I'll just grab the charger. So does it just turn on and leave it running? I had an issue with Diane's where the Wi-Fi wasn't connecting on the login screen. Is Mike's laptop cabled in, or is it on Wi-Fi?

**Speaker 1:** I'd imagine it's Wi-Fi.

**Cameron:** Is this Wi-Fi not working then?

**Speaker 1:** I think... It should work, yeah.

**Cameron:** Right, I'll just turn it on now. He gave me the password, so I can just... Is there a way we could potentially cable it in?

**Speaker 1:** We can put it on this one over here.

**Cameron:** Is there, like, because with Diane, what I think happened was it's like an enterprise-grade Wi-Fi, so you have to sign into the Wi-Fi with an email and a password, I think, and it wasn't working on Diane. Joe P is, but Joe H isn't.

**Speaker 1:** Right, I'll just, let me just turn it on and then... Ah, I can see it. It's online.

**Cameron:** Is it online? Let me just log in. Do I have to log in, or can you do that?

**Speaker 1:** I think I'm OK actually. Can I just click around quick?

**Cameron:** I think... Yeah, I'll let you just click on. OK, Mike's configured it to... It looks like it's working now on Wi-Fi. I think we're OK on Wi-Fi. We're able just to plug in the charger, and then I can crack on, that's all.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, let me plug it in. I'll put it like this. That's right. OK, so I'm just going to plug it in. This is still working because you've got this.

**Cameron:** Right, it's charging now, so you can just... Is that all good? Should we just leave that going?

**Speaker 1:** It appears that I have been disconnected from it again. Is the Wi-Fi on? Does it look like it's got Wi-Fi in the bottom corner?

**Cameron:** No, it's got the little circle now that's like the Wi-Fi at the bottom. It's looking like the Wi-Fi isn't working. Have you got any stations that have network cables or a docking station with a network cable?

**Speaker 1:** I think it can now go on guest.

**Cameron:** Yeah, if you go on guest... I can try this. All right. Yeah, so this laptop's really annoying, it doesn't have... it has to be on the Wi-Fi.

**Speaker 1:** OK. It's weird how it connected and then went off. Maybe it wasn't reaching it if it was working through there.

**Cameron:** There we go. Can you see it now, the Wi-Fi working?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, it takes a little while to connect though, give me a sec. It sometimes takes 15, 20 seconds. It should, in theory...

**Cameron:** Yeah, yeah, I'm back on.

**Speaker 1:** Right. If you drop out, just give me a phone and I can put you back on.

**Cameron:** Yeah, cool. OK. Thank you. I appreciate your help.

**Speaker 1:** Brilliant. Cheers then.

**Cameron:** Cheers. Take care. Bye.

**Speaker 1:** Bye.
