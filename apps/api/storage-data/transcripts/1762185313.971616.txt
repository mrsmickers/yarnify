**Speaker 1:**  
Good afternoon, Ingenio. How can I help?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yeah, good afternoon. It's Chris from Iconic. Is that Louise?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, it is.

**Speaker 2:**  
Hiya, Louise. You okay?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yeah, I'm good, thank you. You okay?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yeah, very good, thank you. It was just a quick catch-up call. I know you did give me a try a couple of months ago on the all-in-ones, the six all-in-ones, which I couldn't support you on, I'm afraid.

**Speaker 1:**  
That's fine. It was just to see if there's any more opportunities at the moment.

**Speaker 2:**  
No, there's nothing else at the moment. Is it worth me adding? Because I've always been focused on the refurb when I've spoken to you, Louise, and I know that's very few and far between. But we do a lot of new stock, especially on the Dell Joe laptops. You've got some new Dell all-in-ones in there, monitors, etc. Is it worth me adding them?

**Speaker 1:**  
We don't generally do all-in-ones. It was just that particular client, and she had no money, so she wanted refurb. We don't ever do refurb, and we don't generally do all-in-ones. It's always Dell, and it will be laptops or PCs, predominantly laptops.

**Speaker 2:**  
So, yeah, it's worth sending me those.

**Speaker 1:**  
Well, I'll get them sent across for you, and it'll have the full list of laptops, and everything comes with a full Dell warranty on there. It does sit in the description. I think they're all three-year. We normally do a five-year, so they need to be upgradable to five-year. I know some are on a specialist thing, aren't they, where you can't upgrade it from three-year.

**Speaker 2:**  
We only do five-year. We've got one customer we do three-year for because they have a three-year lifecycle, and they rotate every three years. For everyone else, you need a five-year.

**Speaker 1:**  
It's five years, yeah.

**Speaker 2:**  
Right. Probably understood. Excellent. Well, thanks for sharing that information. It makes me stop my avenue on refurb and other things, and I know exactly what you need. So, I'll send that across for you, Louise, and as always, I appreciate that.

**Speaker 1:**  
Perfect. No worries. Thank you for your call.

**Speaker 2:**  
Thank you. Take care. Bye.

**Speaker 1:**  
Bye.
