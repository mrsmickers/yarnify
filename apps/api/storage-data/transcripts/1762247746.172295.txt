**Speaker 1:** I can see you've got quite a bit of stuff open at the moment. So, it does want you to log in and log back out, but until you do that, you can do it at lunch or something. I have reset it to the reco for now. When you log out and log back in, just let me know if that flips back.

**Speaker 2:** I can do that now, it's fine. They're just all my programs I have open.

**Speaker 1:** All right, yeah. So when you say log out, not restart or shut down, just log out?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I mean, restart also works, but logging out should be enough if you want to go ahead and just close all your...

**Speaker 1:** Can I close this?

**Speaker 2:** Sure, yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. No, it's just everything I have ready to go.

**Speaker 2:** Ready, yeah, okay.

**Speaker 1:** Like when you called, I kind of had just finished what I was doing actually, so that worked out. Okay, let me add a new printer.

**Speaker 2:** No, you want me to sign out, don't you?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, signing out's good. Sorry, I'm not used to the new layout yet still. It's quicker logging in, by the way.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, that's good.

**Speaker 1:** Since the new update.

**Speaker 2:** That's a nice surprise.

**Speaker 1:** That's much better. So do you want me to...

**Speaker 2:** No, let's just, let me, I can check it first.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Can we not just remove the Dirkin thing?

**Speaker 2:** We can, we should be able to now. Yeah, that seems to have kept the settings, so it's still on the reco for now. I can remove this.

**Speaker 1:** Just because it's like, yeah.

**Speaker 2:** That one's currently the default, so just keep an eye on it. Hopefully, it'll stay that way. I think there was a bit of a policy change possibly last week that might have caused that. That's been removed now, so hopefully that shouldn't happen again.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Just keep an eye on it.

**Speaker 1:** But is that just on mine, that you've done that, rather than everybody here at FOC?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, no, that's just on yours.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** The policy's been changed everywhere, so as long as they go into the reco and set it as default, then that should reach that.

**Speaker 1:** Can they do that themselves?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Right, okay. So what you'll probably find is that in printers and scanners, they'll have Durkin's printer there.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** And it'll say default.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker 1:** So you just want to click on the reco one.

**Speaker 2:** Yep.

**Speaker 1:** And set that as default.

**Speaker 2:** Yep, okay.

**Speaker 1:** And that should sort them out, but let me know if you get back.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah. Well, Neil and TJ are in tomorrow, so I'll do their computers tomorrow then.

**Speaker 1:** Sure.

**Speaker 2:** And then I don't know about the boys. I can have a look. Some of them leave their computers on, actually, so I'll go have a look.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I was just thinking that. I mean, okay, have a look and let me know if you need a hand.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker 1:** All right, then. Thanks, Zane.

**Speaker 2:** Thank you, Amy. Take care.

**Speaker 1:** Thanks. Bye.
