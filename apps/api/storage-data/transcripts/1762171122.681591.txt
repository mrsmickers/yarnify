George:  
Afternoon, Rachel. It's George phoning from Ingenio Technologies. I hope you had a good weekend and enjoyed the game on Saturday. Not a bad result. I'm just following up, firstly, as a gentle reminder that we're going to be doing the half-hour's work later today. Also, I wanted to confirm if I can potentially get access to a PC that's not in use. I had a thought about the set screen, and I want to uninstall it and then reboot to make sure I can get to the screens we need. It would just involve turning on a laptop in the office that's not in use and having a bit of a play around with it. As always, the best number to reach us on is 01273 806211. Many thanks. Bye.
