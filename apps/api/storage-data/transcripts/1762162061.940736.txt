Speaker 1: Hello?

Speaker 2: Hiya, it's Joel calling from the DNEA.

Speaker 1: Hi Joel, how are you doing?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm fine.

Speaker 1: Good. You said something about leave, was that all okay?

Speaker 2: Ah, well, it was, except I didn't write the password down properly and I wasn't able to get in all weekend. Then I rang up at 8 o'clock and said, "Cameron, I can't get in with this password, what is it?" And then he started going, "I'll try Q-U-E-U." I was like, "Oh, fuck off, it worked, didn't it?" So I've been trying to come up with different combinations of the password you gave me all weekend. Then Cameron just said, "Why don't you try this?" and I was like, "Oh, I hate you." Anyway, yeah, so the long and short of it is, we are now in and everything looks okay so far.

Speaker 1: Yeah, wonderful. Okay, that's great. Any issues or things like that, let me know.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I will do. Thanks, Joel. See you later.

Speaker 1: Bye. Thanks very much.

Speaker 2: Bye.
