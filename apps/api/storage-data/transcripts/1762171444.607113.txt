Good afternoon, Ingenio Technologies. George speaking. How can we help?

**Rachel:**  
Hi George, it's Rachel at GreenMob.

**George:**  
Hey Rachel, how are you doing? Sorry, I thought I'd do the spiel just in case.

**Rachel:**  
That's okay. So yeah, you just sent me a message and I couldn't really hear most of it.

**George:**  
Yep, I've got a reminder to... Just as a quick reminder, is today still okay to go ahead with all the bits and pieces?

**Rachel:**  
Yep, that's fine. No worries. And essentially, is there any device in the office that's not being used today that I could kind of just use for some testing, just to make sure that...

**George:**  
Yep, there are two laptops.

**Rachel:**  
No worries.

**George:**  
Actually, three laptops that will be used. I mean, if they're not being used, I don't suppose we could get them turned on now, could we? If that's okay, I might as well just see if we can do some bits now.

**Rachel:**  
Sure, yep. If that works.

**George:**  
No problem. We've got desk two; there's nobody there at the moment.

**Rachel:**  
No trouble.

**George:**  
Desk three laptop is available, and Olga's laptop.

**Rachel:**  
Perfect. If I could get you just to get those switched on and signed in for me, if that's okay.

**George:**  
Yep. And I should then just see them come online, and yeah, I'll connect up, just see the mouse whizzing around, and we'll go from there, if that works for you.

**Rachel:**  
Okay. All right, I'll do that now. Thank you so much for your help. Really appreciate it. Bye.
