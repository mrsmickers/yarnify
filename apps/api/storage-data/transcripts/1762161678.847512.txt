**Cameron:** Hello, Ingenio, Cameron speaking.

**Katrina:** Oh yes, hello Cameron, it's Katrina calling from Lukecraft Hodge and the Doors in Rustington.

**Cameron:** Hello, hi, how are you?

**Katrina:** I'm good, how are you?

**Cameron:** Good, yeah, not bad, thank you. I've got a problem. I can't get onto the server this morning.

**Katrina:** Okay.

**Cameron:** Everyone else seems okay, it's just me that's being kicked off and I can't get back on.

**Katrina:** What does it say when you try? I mean the drive there, like the network drive.

**Cameron:** It says, so if I try and access it, the location is not available. It says it's unavailable. If the location is on the PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disk is inserted and then try again.

**Katrina:** Okay. There is more, but I don't know if you want me to read it.

**Cameron:** No, no, that's okay. I kind of know roughly what it's doing. Yeah, I'll have to make a ticket so we can call you back. I think, yeah, we had the issue before. It's a very random one because it pops up on different machines from time to time.

**Katrina:** I've heard, yeah, Johnny, I think, has had the same problem. Guy just told me.

**Cameron:** Yeah, we had it as well from some other machines and I basically just sort of changed the way it was mapped to make sure that it always kind of showed up and usually didn't come back. But I think we just need to go around, yeah, maybe have a look at the machines that are having the issue still. It's so random though. It's been fine since we've been back and now it's just started doing this. I'm like, oh God.

**Katrina:** Okay, that's fine. Would it be today, do you know?

**Cameron:** Yes, yeah, it should be today, yeah.

**Katrina:** Okay, okay, that's great. Thank you so much.

**Cameron:** Okay. Cheers. Bye.

**Katrina:** Bye-bye.
