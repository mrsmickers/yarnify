Automated Message: We know we sell managed printers. Never pay for toner, consumables, or repairs again with our fast and colorful printers. Simply pay for what you print. When you're running low on toner, you're sent more automatically. Enjoy full support, repairs, and parts for as little as $20.

Receptionist: Good afternoon, Ingenio. How can I help?

Caller: Hello? Yeah, afternoon. Yeah, I was hoping you could get me through to Simon first.

Receptionist: He's not available, I'm afraid. Can I take a message?

Caller: As you know, I'm nervous. Yeah, I won't say anything to you, but I appreciate it. Thank you. Bye now.
