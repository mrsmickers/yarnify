Speaker 1: Oh, hi, it's Cameron again. Sorry, the laptop—I restarted it, and then I think it disconnected from the Wi-Fi. I can't really tell. 

Speaker 2: Yeah, the Wi-Fi dropped out for like the whole building.

Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, it was just... yeah. It's probably my fault for not telling it to auto-connect. What I didn't want to do is tell it to auto-connect to the guest Wi-Fi because that means when Mike actually uses it, it will auto-connect to the guest Wi-Fi. So is it possible to maybe just go to the Wi-Fi and just get it to connect to one just as a one-off on his laptop? 

Speaker 2: On to the guest one?

Speaker 1: Yeah, either one. Yeah, just whichever one connects.

Speaker 2: Okay, I'll just go and grab it and then give me a sec, I'll bring it.

Speaker 1: Okay, thanks. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah, I think what I was... so I started with just like having a quick scan over their custom notes and doing a bit of research into the people before I pick up the phone. So I'm not going to just like... I'll just start cold calling the decision makers in the company. 

Speaker 2: Okay, you should see it now.

Speaker 1: Cool, thank you. As long as it's on the Wi-Fi, I can log back in as our admin account and yeah, go from there.

Speaker 2: Cool, thanks. I'll give you a shout if I get stuck.

Speaker 1: Thank you. 

Speaker 2: Okay, thanks, bye.

Speaker 1: Bye.
