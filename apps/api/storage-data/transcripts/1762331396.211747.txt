**Speaker 1:** Hello, and thank you for calling Stover UK.

**Speaker 2:** Hello, Stover UK, Rob speaking.

**Speaker 3:** Hey Rob, this is Leanna from Ingenio. How are you?

**Speaker 2:** Hiya, how are you doing?

**Speaker 3:** I'm good, thanks. You doing good?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, good, thank you.

**Speaker 3:** Excellent. You should have the project now.

**Speaker 2:** Excellent. I think I did see an email. Yeah. Let's see. Ah, okay. Apparently, I didn't finish logging in. Give me a minute. What PC are you on?

**Speaker 3:** Uh, 42.

**Speaker 2:** 42. Well, the meaning of everything. Okay. Have you used Project before?

**Speaker 3:** I have. I used a trial version of it.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, cool. And you've used a really older version of it?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, an ancient version of it. Back in the day.

**Speaker 2:** So if you open up a web browser, my dear.

**Speaker 3:** Yep.

**Speaker 2:** And you go to office.com.

**Speaker 3:** Sorry, say that again?

**Speaker 2:** Office.com.

**Speaker 3:** Office.com.

**Speaker 2:** It should ask you to log in to 365.

**Speaker 3:** Yep. Ooh. Look at you. You've got two screens. And you need to update your Chrome.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, do I?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah. When you're done with it, just kind of flip. So if we go to apps. Come on. Wakey, wakey. I'm just going to open this one because it's easier to get the things up. Where's Project? PowerPoint, SharePoint. Oh, you bastard. Okay, hold on. I'm going to go to, where is it? I'm going to tab. They just left nothing with me. I know that. They think that this is amazing. It doesn't matter. These people don't care.

**Speaker 2:** No.

**Speaker 3:** Okay. Come on. That will pop up faster. What? Planner. That's not Project. What the heck? Project. Oh. The projects live in Planner? Oh, please say it ain't true. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay. This used to be really simple. You'd log into here and then it would work and then you'd see it. But it's not. It's hiding. It's hiding. Project management. Why does it keep on just giving me Planner? Install app. Oh. Okay. I'll tell you what, my dear. I'm really sorry. It should be around here somewhere. Let me call you back.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 3:** I'll leave you logged in here for the moment.

**Speaker 2:** Yep.

**Speaker 3:** So let me call you back. Let me find out where the hell it went.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. I might be going into a meeting in a minute.

**Speaker 3:** Okay. That's fine. I'll call you back afterwards.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Cool. Thanks, Mick.

**Speaker 3:** Cheers. Bye-bye.

**Speaker 2:** Cheers.
