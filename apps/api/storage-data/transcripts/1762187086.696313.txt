**Speaker 1:** Hello?

**Speaker 2:** Hi, it's Joel calling from Engineering.

**Speaker 1:** Hello.

**Speaker 2:** Hiya. Apologies for the delay on this. It's been a bit crazy over here. We've had a few staff outages. I'm just calling about the issues you've been having with the trackpad or something to do with that, anyway, with weird mouse clicks on your machine.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I don't really know.

**Speaker 2:** Hmm, okay. It's a bit strange, but I've dealt with it before.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, okay. Sometimes you delete one item, you click on it, and you press delete. I don't know, I don't think that's a switch keyboard, and then all of a sudden, it just carries on deleting the lot. And then sometimes you type something, and you hit an L, and it just keeps going with the L.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** And then you quickly hit escape, and it stops it.

**Speaker 2:** Interesting.

**Speaker 1:** When you're deleting, you can't get to it in time. It's so fast, and it deletes them. Fortunately, I went through them all on Thursday because I was off Friday. I only have about 41 I've got in there. So fortunately, I was down to that. I probably still have ones I worked out I didn't want.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Yeah, that's really odd. So it sounds like it's something with the keyboard as well. If I just delete your first one, and then you literally watch them go, and you think, ah, I'm done with that. It's a lot of gone.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** It's definitely sounding like there's something hardware-wise, I'd say. But I've looked at the keyboard, and I've held it up to my eye. No keys are pressed, or dinked, or bent. Do you know what I mean?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I was going to ask. It's not bulging at all, or any weird...

**Speaker 2:** No, it's fine. I've turned it on and off. But I mean, is it related to the fact that that screen rolls up when you turn it on, which is weird? Is it going to be something like that?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, it would be related. It's definitely something to do with the same thing with the keyboard or the trackpad. It's worth doing some tests, if that's okay, on the keyboard, especially. See if it's like any keys or something are being stuck down.

**Speaker 2:** I don't think it is.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. If I open a web page, we should actually be able to see if it's detecting any keys being pressed.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, of course. Give that a go?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. We can also run diagnostics. Does this happen when it's just the laptop on its own, with no external keyboard or anything like that attached?

**Speaker 1:** I mean, hardly ever use it that way. I mean, hardly ever.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Really aren't for that. Right. Okay. Have you got any different external keyboards or things like that you could use to swap them out with? Just roll them out, if that makes sense?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I could do. I'm not convinced with keyboards, personally. I mean, I've got a laptop, and I've got a laptop, and I've got a...

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I'm not seeing it detect anything being pressed. Let's see if I can run some Dell diagnostics and see if it finds anything odd. I need Dell SupportAssist. Let me grab that from their website. I am wondering whether this might be something it's easier to come in for, rather than remote, if it's something physical going on. But yeah, let's try ruling things out first, and then we can go from there. So, SupportAssist does have some diagnostics in it that we can run. I'm just going to take a look at the logs, see if there's anything strange in there at all. But I believe Zane also changed a sleep setting because I know you were having some issues with that.

**Speaker 1:** Took that away. That's good.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. There's a few things in here, but it's nothing abnormal.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, that's fine.

**Speaker 2:** So, that's probably going to take at least 10 minutes or so. Would it be okay just to stay on here for like 10 minutes or so, and just go through some checks, and then I can call you back in a bit, if that's okay?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, no worries, mate.

**Speaker 2:** Wonderful. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to run some checks, if that's okay with yourself.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, no worries, mate.

**Speaker 2:** Lovely. All right. Okay. I'll speak to you in a bit.

**Speaker 1:** All right. Thanks.

**Speaker 2:** Bye.
