**Speaker 1:** Hello?

**Speaker 2:** Hiya, it's Joel. Are you calling from Eugenie?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, hi. Hi, apologies, I'm a bit late calling. I've just been stuck on a previous ticket for a moment. I'm just calling about getting Sentinel One up and running with permissions on your MacBook.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, yeah, I thought that was already up and running, wasn't it?

**Speaker 1:** Okay, yeah, it just needed a couple of full disk permissions, but that's literally it. It should only take a minute. Is it okay to jump on?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's fine.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, just jumping on there now. Oh, I need to update my software as well.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we already had an alert that you were running an out-of-date version. I can show you where to update that if you like.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I know how to do that actually. Do you want me to do that first?

**Speaker 2:** You don't have to do it just yet. You can do that maybe at the end of the day or something like that. It's not urgent. It's just something we check up on basically.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Let's see if we can grant these permissions. There are a couple of hidden permissions you see that Sentinel One needs, and I suspect that's what's missing. So I'm just going to take a quick look and see if I can find those.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, that might be it. Sometimes when there's a software update for Sentinel One, it kind of has a moment. Would you be able to pop in your administrator login for me?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I'm trying to remember what it is now. I think it's the full word. In fact, we can find out. How can I find out what the administrator is? I can go by users, can't I?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, if you go to users.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, see where the administrator is. Okay, so now I'll go back to security. So what were we trying to do here?

**Speaker 1:** So it's the full disk permissions it needs so it's able to scan properly. Oops, we're just at the top. That's the one here, the little gray icon. And then if I press this here, there we go. And I have to remember what that is there.

**Speaker 2:** No, that's not going to work. I could always try with the remote support login as well.

**Speaker 1:** I'll remember it, I'll find it. I need to make sure I've got it somewhere I can find more easily actually.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** I think I'm going to try one more. No, that didn't seem to work.

**Speaker 2:** One thing you could try doing is just removing the spaces in the administrator name. Sometimes it's a little funny having those spaces in there.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, really? Okay. So we take those out.

**Speaker 2:** I think it usually works without doing that actually. No, try again in a minute.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, what is it?

**Speaker 2:** You can always reset it if you like as well.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, really?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we can reset them.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, let me just see if I can find it. Yeah, I need to make sure I can find it more easily actually. I did some when I came in. But I did remember it. It's one of a few things. Just trying to make sure I get it right so that when I try it again it doesn't get tired of me trying it.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, would it be possible for me to try the remote support login in the meantime just so we can check that one's working?

**Speaker 1:** What's that one?

**Speaker 2:** So this is the one we have basically. It's just to make sure everything's all working. And it also means we're able to reset other passwords and bits like that. So I can try using this one instead and see if that works. And using this we can get the other one reset.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, I probably don't want to do that, Joe.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, okay. Joe?

**Speaker 1:** Joel, Joel, sorry. Is that how it's usually set up?

**Speaker 2:** So yeah, usually there is a separate remote support account that we add automatically. And that basically means we have administrator rights for the PC.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, and I think it's probably fine. Hang on, it won't let me. Okay, let's just cancel that and try it again. Okay, so what do I do here?

**Speaker 2:** So if we go down to the little plus at the bottom there.

**Speaker 1:** Okay.

**Speaker 2:** Let's try that again. And then it should be. Try again in five minutes there.

**Speaker 1:** Well, should we... We need that in order to set up what you're trying to set up, don't we?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, so we need to go... Do you want to call back shortly and I'll make what I need to do first. Let's make sure I can get on. I'll find the right password and then we can get on and do what we need to do. I've got a couple of other questions as well.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, that's fine. The one thing to note is if we keep trying, that timeout period will get longer and longer.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** So after a while, it might just be best to reset the password if you're happy to do that. Because otherwise, that period is going to get longer and longer and eventually it will lock you out completely.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** So, I mean, I'm more than happy for you to try it again. But, yeah, that is just something to be aware of that it will eventually lock you out completely.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah. Should we put this into sort of later in the day because then I can update because I need to back up first. Then I can update and then we can make sure that's all right as well because that sounds better. And I can make sure I've got the password and can get on and don't have to re... If I reset it, then I've got to remember the new one again. I know I haven't remembered this one, but I'm going to get mixed up between...

**Speaker 1:** That's all right. I've got half an hour at 3:30 today if that works.

**Speaker 2:** 3:30. Yeah, that would be good because I've also got... Would you be the person to ask the questions of cyber security as well?

**Speaker 1:** I'm not, I'm afraid. No, not really. It kind of depends what the question's about, however.

**Speaker 2:** Well, it's basically sort of what security things we have set up. Sentinel-1, da-da-da. Crypto's laptop, what that is. All sorts of things like that. It's pretty basic questions. It's just I don't know the answers. Would you know those or should I set up a call with somebody else for those?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, so on each laptop, you've got Sentinel-1 for your anti-malware, and you've also got Cisco Secure Client, which is your web filtering.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, it's that sort of thing. Do you know that or should I... It sounds like you know all... Or should I set that with Cameron?

**Speaker 1:** I think maybe Cameron is the person. Who should I...

**Speaker 2:** Cameron's kind of our cyber security guy, so if you've got some complicated questions, it's probably best you speak to him.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, I'll book up a call.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if you can pop a new ticket into us with some details, we can get that assigned over and get that booked in if you're happy to do that.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, in the meantime, I'll just update this, and then we can make sure, because I don't want you to do it, me update the software, and it throws something out, and we have to do it again, I'm thinking, as well. And I'll make sure I know all the passwords, too, so I don't have to reset any. So, yeah, I'll deal with that. So you'll give me a call at 3:30?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I'll give you a call then.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, brilliant. Thank you.

**Speaker 2:** All right, speak to you later.

**Speaker 1:** All right, thank you. Bye.

**Speaker 2:** Bye.
