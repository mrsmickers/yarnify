Speaker 1: Good afternoon, Ingenio. How can I help?

Speaker 2: Yeah, good afternoon. It's Chris from Iconic. Is that Louise?

Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

Speaker 2: Hiya, Louise. You OK?

Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm good, thank you. You OK?

Speaker 2: Yeah, very good, thank you. It was just a quick catch-up call. I know you did give me a try a couple of months ago on the all-in-ones, the six all-in-ones, which I couldn't support you on, I'm afraid.

Speaker 1: That's right.

Speaker 2: It was just to see if there's any more opportunities at the moment.

Speaker 1: No, there's nothing else at the moment. Is it worth me adding, because I've always been focused on the refurb when I've spoken to you, Louise, and I know that's very few and far between, but we do a lot of new stock, especially on the Dell laptop. You've got some new Dell all-in-ones in there, monitors, etc. Is it worth me adding?

Speaker 1: We don't generally do all-in-ones. It was just that particular client, and she had no money, so she wanted refurb. We don't ever do refurb, and we don't generally do all-in-ones. It's always Dell, and it will be laptops or PCs, predominantly laptops. So, yes, it's worth sending me those.

Speaker 2: Brilliant. Well, I'll get them sent across for you, and it'll have the full list of laptops, and everything comes with a full Dell warranty on there. It does state in the description. I think they're all for a year. We normally do a five-year, so they need to be upgradable to five-year. I know some are on a special thing, aren't they, where you can't upgrade it from three-year. We only do five-year. We've got one customer we do three-year for, because they have a three-year life cycle, and they rotate every three years. For everyone else, you need a five-year.

Speaker 1: It's five years, yes.

Speaker 2: Right. Perfectly understood. Excellent. Well, thanks for sharing that information. It makes me stop my having you on refurb and other things, and I know exactly what you need. I'll send that across for you, Louise, and as always, I appreciate your time.

Speaker 1: Perfect. No worries. Thank you for your call.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Take care.

Speaker 1: Bye.

Speaker 2: Bye.
