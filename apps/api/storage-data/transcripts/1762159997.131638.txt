Receptionist: Good morning, Ingenio. How can I help?

Caller: Oh, hi, good morning. Can I just find out about my order? What's happening? Do I need to wait a bit longer? I've got a ticket number.

Receptionist: Yeah, what's your ticket number?

Caller: The order ticket is hashtag 1421644.

Receptionist: Let me have a look. Are you calling from Active Sussex?

Caller: Sorry?

Receptionist: Are you calling from Active Sussex?

Caller: Yes, I am, yes.

Receptionist: Yeah, let me have a look at what's on that. Zane is scheduled in on that ticket for tomorrow.

Caller: Oh, okay. So, is someone going to come back to me, or is he…?

Receptionist: I'm just trying to read the ticket. I'm not tech, so I don't actually know what they do.

Caller: Ah, no worries.

Receptionist: She's booked in for 9:45 AM tomorrow until 10:45 AM, so she's got an hour booked on that. I will double-check when she comes in and get her to contact you.

Caller: Yes, please, because I haven't heard anything. I don't know whether it's remote or in-person.

Receptionist: It will be remote, I would assume. But Zane will be in shortly. Is she on-site today? Let me have a look. She's on-site this morning. She'll be in this afternoon. So, I will speak to her and get her to contact you, just to run through what she's going to need.

Caller: Yes, okay.

Receptionist: Okay, great. Thank you.

Caller: No problem. Thank you.

Receptionist: Thanks a lot. Bye.
