Speaker 1: Hiya, it's John, calling from Ingenio.

Speaker 2: Oh, hi.

Speaker 1: Hi. I'm just trying to get in touch with Katrina.

Speaker 2: Speaking.

Speaker 1: Oh, hi. I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.

Speaker 2: Oh, is that better?

Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it, I can hear you now.

Speaker 2: Apologies, I think my mic was in the slightly wrong position.

Speaker 1: Oh, right. I'm just calling about some issues you're facing connecting to the server this morning.

Speaker 2: I am, yes, the server, that's it.

Speaker 1: Hmm, okay. Would I be able to jump on and take a look?

Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.

Speaker 1: Wonderful, okay. Is it the file server?

Speaker 2: It is, yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay, I'm just going to get that disconnected and then reconnected. Let's take a look. I'm just going to grab the credentials for that. Sorry, I just put my food order in.

Speaker 2: That's alright.

Speaker 1: Cool, I'm going to hit remember on there and it should... there we go, so that's been re-added as the F drive. If you could try again for me.

Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, I was trying to get on to my stuff. Yeah, it looks like it's working.

Speaker 1: Nice, that's all back there.

Speaker 2: Okay, cool. What do I do if it happens again?

Speaker 1: Unfortunately not much you can do.

Speaker 2: Okay, I'll just keep ringing then.

Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm afraid there's not much because it's the administrative credentials that you need. But give us a ring, we can get it reconnected.

Speaker 2: Yeah, that's brilliant, thanks for doing that.

Speaker 1: Okay, alright, thanks very much. Bye.
