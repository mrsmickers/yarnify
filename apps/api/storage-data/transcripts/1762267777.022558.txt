Speaker 1: Hi, yeah, it's Joel calling from Engineering.

Speaker 2: Hi, how are you?

Speaker 1: Hi, yeah, not bad, thanks. I'm just working on setting up the laptops for you today.

Speaker 2: Yep.

Speaker 1: I've just tried to sign into the InfoWorth account, but I'm not sure if the details we have are still up to date.

Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: So I've got the password here, and I can pop it on your screen, but I'm not sure if it's been changed in the last few months by any chance.

Speaker 2: Okay, not that I know of, but bring it up and I'll tell you.

Speaker 1: Yes, all right, I'm just going to pop it on the screen now. That's the one we've got on file. Is that still correct?

Speaker 2: Oh, I think it's got a number at the end. Hold on.

Speaker 1: No worries. Let me just check in Keeper. No, that's a different one. It has 81 before the exclamation mark.

Speaker 2: Ah, I see. That might be why. Let me try that then. Let's see if that works. That should log you into Outlook.

Speaker 1: Oh, yes, that worked. And I've got to get a text from the number ending in 31. I believe that's your number.

Speaker 2: It is. Let's do that.

Speaker 1: Okay, and you should have just got a six-digit code.

Speaker 2: Come on then, where are you? Hold on, I'm just going to stick to the speaker. Oh, here we go.

Speaker 1: That's all right. 408488.

Speaker 2: 408488.

Speaker 1: Yes. Okay. Lovely. It looks like that's signing in. So that's Luke's PC I'm setting up at the moment. Would I be able to give you a call back when I'm setting up Mahu's and then just get that two-factor code again for that machine as well?

Speaker 2: Yes, of course. Yeah, no problem.

Speaker 1: Okay. All right. I'll speak to you in a bit, but hopefully we can get those out for you today.

Speaker 2: That'd be fantastic. Thanks so much.

Speaker 1: All right. Thanks very much. Cheers. Bye.
