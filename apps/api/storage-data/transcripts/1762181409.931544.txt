Thank you for calling Ingenio Technologies. To help us direct your call, please...

**George:** Hi, Rachel. It's George. How are you doing?

**Rachel:** Hiya, George. Are you all right?

**George:** I'm all right. Yes, I'm just playing around in the background, really. Yeah, just somebody called Sylvia is about to use Desk 2. Is that going to be OK?

**Rachel:** Oh, no, no, no. No trouble at all. Let me just sign out. I think I've just signed in. I think that's all right. She'll be not too long here, so I can let you know when we're all...

**George:** No, no, no. No problem. You can just sign in for me. She will be OK, but you can just get her to sign in for me.

**Rachel:** OK. It's me doing it, actually. No trouble. The other two PCs are just sitting on the side, though, so you're all right.

**George:** No worries at all. Yeah, I'm just mucking around with some sort of things in the back end, really, which is no problem.

**Rachel:** OK. Essentially, yeah, once everyone's finished for the day, we will need to just hop around the PCs.

**George:** Yep, I shall leave them all on, yeah. I'll probably leave you for about 10 minutes per PC, just to kind of go through some bits, if that works for yourself, if that's OK.

**Rachel:** Yep, you need me here while you do that, yeah?

**George:** Yes, yeah, yeah. Once that bit's all done, then I can let you get on with your evening, and we'll go from there.

**Rachel:** OK, I'll give you a call a bit later.

**George:** No worries at all. Speak to you then. Take care.

**Rachel:** Cheers, bye.

**George:** Cheers, bye.
